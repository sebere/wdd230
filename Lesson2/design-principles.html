                "This apple page seems to me to show very well the sense of 
                white space and clean design, already in the upper part the only thing 
                there is is the company logo and the minimalist menu icon, the rest is "white space", 
                like this right in the center of the page is the image of the new iphone and the rest 
                of the space is very clean which makes the product stand out. Due to these characteristics 
                it complies with this design principle."

                "On this page we can see how the RULE OF THREE is applied in 
                the main image in the person's gaze, in such a way that it brings 
                all the attention and generates a sense of harmony."

                "The contrast on this page is quite clear, managing only two colors,
                 white and black, it generates in its simplicity that enhance the data, 
                 although it is simple, it does not mean that it does not have a design 
                 that allows harmony between the elements."
